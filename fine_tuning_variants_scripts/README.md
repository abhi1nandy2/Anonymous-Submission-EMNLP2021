## Fine Tuning Variants

### Files

1. `utils.py` - contains helper functions
2. `unsupervised_IR_plus_SR.py` - applying the `TFIDF` method (`T5` is already applied to the E-Manual sections before this) to get top 10 sections pertaining to a question, followed by fine-tuning SR method
3. `SR_infer_section.py` - applying the fine-tuned SR model to infer/predict the relevant section, given a question, which would serve as input to `AR_sentence_wise.py` and `AR_token_wise.py`
4.  `AR_sentence_wise.py` - fine-tuning sentence wise AR
5.  `AR_token_wise.py` - fine-tuning token wise AR
6.  `add_t5_to_paras.py` - add questions generated by T5 to sections extracted from an E-Manual.
